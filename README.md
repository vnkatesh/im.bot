*Overview*
This is a random chat bot that I made on my 2nd last day at IIT Roorkee. The idea was an always-available chat-bot for [IMG](https://github.com/IMGIITRoorkee) that
would respond to certain specific queries like 'search for person given the name' - etc. This was very [Channel I](http://example.net/) applications specific.

Again, if the incoming chat queries do not match specific patterns, it would be redirected to an AI bot ProgramD.

It's obviously not perfect, was coded from scratch within 3 hours, with possibly lots of bugs and hasn't been run in over a number of years.
